Upstream comes with its own copy of the Clipper C++ polygon clipping
library, which they compile into a static library that gets included
into the Python wheel. On Alpine Linux, we prefer to use the shared
library from package `clipper` so that the exact same implementation
gets called across the system. Also, linking to a system-wide shared
library reduces total installation size when Clipper gets called
from both Python and non-Python code.
