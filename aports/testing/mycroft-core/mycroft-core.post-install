mycroft-core installs with the most basic skills required to get the package working.
If you want all the official MycroftAI skills, consider installing the mycroft-skills meta package.

Since there currently isn't a single end-point to start Mycroft, you'll need to run the following manually:
- /usr/bin/mycroft-messagebus
- /usr/bin/mycroft-audio
- /usr/bin/mycroft-speech-client
- /usr/bin/mycroft-skills
- /usr/bin/mycroft-cli-client
